# LED-Light-Sculpture
This LED Light Sculputre was originally a little birthday gift I made for a friend, but turned into a little more...so I ended up building a number of them for various occasions :smile:

## Getting Started

Due to the nature of this project, the code isn't necessarily transferrable to other domains unless you built an LED sculpture as well (and if you've built a similar project I would love to see what you created! :smile: )

## Built With

* [Arduino Nano] - The microcontroller used
* [WS2812B RGB 5050 LED Array] â€“ LED array inside the sculpture
* [1/8" Cast Acrylic]
* [SPDT (Single Pole, Double Throw) Switch]
* [Momentary Push Button]
* [USB Micro Cable]
* [USB Wall Charger]

## Purchasing Options
Obviously you can browse the Internet for the best deals, but here's the list of items I used for this project:

## CAD Files

The necessary STL files are provided in the docs so you can print your own sculpture!  Feel free to modify it how you see fit :smile:

## AI Files

I have provided a template for the circular design that I wanted.  You will need this for cutting the arcylic with a laser cutter or CNC machine.

## Acknowledgements

S/O to [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2742) for their inspiration and providing a lot of templates/demo code for this project.  Honestly, I would bridge the gap between our two approaches and do whatever works best for you and your design.  Make it your own, that's what being a Maker is all about :smile:
